## 🚧 Current Challenges

1. **Lack of Real-World Data**  
   The current model was trained using synthetic data due to time limitations, affecting result accuracy and delaying the integration of other system tools.

2. **Computational Limitations**  
   Training advanced models requires high computational power and specialized storage for visual and biometric data, which are currently unavailable.

3. **Absence of Video/Biometric Analytics**  
   Some core tools (e.g., performance tracking modules) rely on non-textual data formats (e.g., video, biometrics), which have not been processed yet.
